# Milestone-2 Repository at Campus 42 Barcelona

Welcome to my Milestone-2 repository at Campus 42 Barcelona! This repository contains my projects for this milestone, focusing on advanced algorithmic challenges and system-level programming. Here, I am working on **Push_swap** and **Pipex**, which are key projects in my journey to mastering C programming.

## Current Projects

### 1. **Push_swap**
**Push_swap** is a project focused on implementing an algorithm to sort numbers using two stacks with minimal operations. This project helps improve my understanding of data structures and algorithms, aiming for an efficient sorting method.

### 2. **Pipex**
**Pipex** involves developing a simplified version of the Unix `pipe` command to handle inter-process communication and execute commands in sequence. This project enhances my skills in process management and system programming.
