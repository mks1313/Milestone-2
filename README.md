# Milestone-2 Repository at Campus 42 Barcelona

Welcome to my **Milestone-2** repository at **Campus 42 Barcelona**! This repository showcases the projects I have worked on during this milestone, focusing on advanced algorithmic challenges and system-level programming. Here, I am primarily working on **Push_swap** and **Pipex**, two pivotal projects in my journey towards mastering C programming.

## Current Projects

### 1. **Push_swap**
**Push_swap** is a project where I implement an algorithm to sort numbers using two stacks with minimal operations. The challenge lies in optimizing the number of operations performed to sort the numbers efficiently. This project has significantly deepened my understanding of data structures and algorithms, particularly stack management, and it helps sharpen my problem-solving skills.

### 2. **Pipex**
**Pipex** is about developing a simplified version of the Unix `pipe` command to handle inter-process communication (IPC) and execute commands sequentially using pipes. This project enhances my skills in system-level programming, process management, and understanding of how Unix handles processes and input/output redirection.

## 3. **Fractol**
**Fractol** is a graphical programming project where I generate and render fractals like the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. The project involves creating an interactive program that allows the user to zoom in and explore various parts of these complex mathematical structures. This project enhanced my understanding of graphical programming using **MinilibX** and improved my ability to handle user inputs and mathematical concepts simultaneously.
